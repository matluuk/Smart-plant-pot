# Smart-plant-pot

Smart plant pot is plant pot that monitors soil moisture, temperature and how much light plant has. 
Lcd display shows sensor readings and when soil moisture is too low buzzer alert to water the plant.
Sensor data are gathered to sd card.

Project is currently work in progress and all features doesn't work yet.
Also this is my first lilttle bit bigger arduino project.

Electronics are done with arduino uno. 
Smart pot uses 1602 lcd display, two buttons and passive buzzer for interaction with user. 
At start I was planing to power electronics using 9v battery, but I it isn't really a good option. 
Currently I am powering electronics through arduino usb port.

All plastic parts are 3d-printed
